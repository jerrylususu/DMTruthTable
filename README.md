# DMTruthTable
An Expression Evaluator, created for Discrete Math Homework.

`TruthTable.java`: Functional Style.

`TruthTableOOP.java`: Traditional OOP Style.

## Usage
1. Put `TruthTable.java`, `TruthTableOOP.java` in the same path.
2. Open `TruthTable.OOP`
3. First add variables, see main() method
4. Then change logical expressions, see eval2() method
5. Run and enjoy!

## TODO
- [x] make it usable.
- [ ] find a more elegent way of inputting expressions (maybe text parsing?)
- [ ] find a more efficient way of creating combinations (maybe iterator?)
